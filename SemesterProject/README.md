## Description

    This is a static site created to reach all of the requirements listed for CMPT120L Semester Project v1.0. 
    This was honestly a lot of fun, and I enjoy how we had to do majority of the work from our own research. Even though it is a simple site, I am immensly proud of the time and effort I put in to the process. 

## Running the Site
    The Site is all set up in the app.py file to be immediatly run without entering the terminal. OR if the terminal is preferred, using the terminal is as simple of double check FLASK_APP=app.py by entering 'echo FLASK_APP' if it is set up enter FLASK run. and the server will start running. 

## Installation
    > Flask. Flask must be installed to run this server
