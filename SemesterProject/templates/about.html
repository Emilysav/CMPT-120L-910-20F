        Hey! So I'm Emily
    </h1>

    <h3>
        Who I am
    </h3>
    <p>
        I grew up in NYC and loved it! 
        My second time away from being in the city was when I went to Marist College's main campus for my sophomore year. 
        My first time away from the city was my Freshman year when I studied in Florence, Italy. 
        It was amazing to expierence a new culture, and see all the gorgeous sights it went by in the blink of an eye and it is something that I will treasure forever. 
        As for being in poughkeepsie, NY.... I can't say I love it, but I appreciate the oppertunity it has given me. 
        Being a first gen college student, I had no idea what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go and Marist gave me the oppertunity to study aborad while I expierenced new careers and fields, 
        and even helped me reach my ultimate major chice Computer Science! Once I officially decided it felt like a giant weight as lifted off my shoulders.

        I am really bad at decision making, so instead of favorites I say "top 3" this way I can say top three when talking about anything and no one will know what the other two are.
